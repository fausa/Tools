# Tools for Data Science 

#### -- Programming Language: Python, Jupyter Notebooks

## Goals
Develop open-source tools to help build upon and use for machine learning/AI projects

## Currently available 
* Data Collection via Webcrawl/Scrape

## Future Tools
* Data Engineering
* Open-Source LLM chats
* Natural language processing
* Transfer learning

## Purpose
A resource for gathered learning around methods to build upon and assist in larger AI projects

## Motivation
Many tools are available at a cost, or through API's when they can be easily implemented by the developer. 
These tools are meant to be a place to start, and might help with some basic needs.

## Usage
1. webscrape.py
   * Copy/clone to personal directory
   * Run from prompt window: python webscrape.py
   * Enter precise parent URL address (make sure to use the secure https name if needed)
   * Enter output filename - data will be output as a JSON file
   * Run
  
## How do the tools work?
Please communicate any errors or shortcomings as these tools are by no means complete and final solutions - that way they can be fixed. 
Thanks in advance âœ¨
